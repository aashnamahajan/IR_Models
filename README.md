<b> Goal : </b>
To implement various IR models, evaluate the IR system and improve the search results based on understanding of the models, the implementation and the evaluation.

<b> Given : </b>

Twitter data in three languages - English, German and Russian, 15 sample queries and the corresponding relevance judgements.
